# My very second web page

Welcome!

## Purpose

This project has been a great intro into Git & GitHub and bringing elements of what I have learnt so far together.
Having run through this a second time it is enforcing some of the learning in my mind clearer.
I am starting to think about the next several steps ahead and planning in my mind what sort of pages I can make next and how they will interact with each other.
There is still a long journey ahead with not a lot of time.

### Tools

Html
CSS
Git
GitHub
Markdown

Links to WiKi pages.

#### To Note:

Thsi is my very second web page as my first failed - I will revisit to debug it.
A cause for confusion for me going through this project was not being able to follow to videos exactly.
I noticed that the videos were not played in the correct order of filming e.g. before learning about Markdown you could see Matt Rudge had already updated his.
You can see Matt has already updated his Markdown in the 'GitHub Pages' video. 
This spurred me to think that maybe I had either missed something or that I should take it upon myself to find a way to chnage it so my screen matched his. This was obvioulsy a mistake and should have only been changing what he was telling me to change.
